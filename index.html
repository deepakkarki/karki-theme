	This will be the file for expreimentation of the template
	Once the design is concrete - will convert into template.

	In the final jekyll theme, there will be a template for 
	* static page
	* blog index
	* project page (same as static page?)
	* blog post

	(Theme for static, blog index, project will mostly remain same)
	
	NOTE : Theme implies the design of the page, the template includes the liquid tags and stuff
			not to be confused with each another.
